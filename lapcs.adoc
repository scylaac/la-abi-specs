== Introduction

This document defines the constraints on the program contexts exchanged between
the caller and called subroutines or a subroutine and the execution environment.
The subroutines following these constraints can be compiled and assembled separately
and work together in the same program. The terms "subroutine", "function" and "procedure"
may be used interchangeably throughout this document.

That includes constraints on:

- The initial program context created by the caller for the callee.
- The program context when the callee finishes its execution and returns to the caller.
- How subroutine arguments and return values should be encoded in these program contexts.
- How certain global states may be accessed and preserved by all subroutines.

However, this document does not formally define how entities of standard programming
languages other than ISO C should be represented in the machine's program context, and
these language bindings should be described separately if needed.

== Processor Architecture

=== The registers

All LoongArch machines have 32 general-purpose registers and optionally 32
floating-point registers. Some of these registers may be used for passing
arguments and return values between the caller and callee subroutines.

The bit-width of both general-purpose registers and floating-point registers
may be either 32- or 64-bit, depending on whether the machine implements the LA32
or LA64 instruction set, and whether or not do they have a single- or double-precision FPU.

NOTE: In the following text, we use the term "temporary register" for
referring to caller-saved registers and "static registers" for callee-saved registers.

=== The memory and the byte order

The memory is byte-addressable for LoongArch machines, and the ordering of the bytes
in machine-supported multi-byte data types is *little-endian*. That is, the least
significant byte of a data object is at the lowest byte address the data object
occupies in memory.

The least significant byte of a 32-bit GPR / 64-bit GPR / 32-bit FPR / 64-bit GPR
is defined as storing the lowest byte of the data loaded from the memory with one
`ld.w` / `ld.d` / `fld.s` / `fld.d` instruction. This byte order is also respected
by other instructions that move typed data across registers such as `movgr2fr.d`.

In this document, when referring to a data object (of any type) stored in a register,
it is assumed that these objects begin with the least significant byte of the register
with no lower-byte paddings.

=== The base ABI variants

Depending on the bit-width of the general-purpose registers and the floating-point
registers, different ABI variants can be adopted to preserve arguments and return
values in the registers as long as it is possible.

variants may result in linker errors or run-time failures.

== Data representation

This specification defines machine data types that represents ISO C's scalar,
aggregate (structure and array) and union data types, as well as their layout
within the program context when passed as arguments and return values of procedures.

|===

NOTE: In the following text, the term "integral object" or
"integral type" also covers the pointers.

[[int_ext_rules]]
When passed in registers as subroutine arguments or return values,
the unsigned integral objects are zero-extended, and the signed
integer data types are sign-extended if the containing register
is larger in size.

One exception to the above rule is that in the *LP64D* ABI, unsigned words,
such as those representing `unsigned int` in <<C-data-types, C>>,
are stored in general-purpose registers as proper _sign extensions_ of
their 32-bit values.

=== Structures, arrays and unions

The following conventional rules are respected:

* Structures, arrays and unions assume the alignment of their most strictly
aligned components (i.e. with the largest natural alignment).

* The size of any object is always a multiple of its alignment.
Tail paddings are applied to aggregates and unions if it is necessary
to comply with this rule. The state of the padding bits are not defined.

* Each member within a structure or an array is consecutively
assigned to the lowest available offset with the appropriate alignment,
in the order of their definitions.

Structs and unions may be passed in registers as arguments or return values.
The layout rules of their members within the registers are described
in the following section.

=== Bit-fields

Structures and unions may include bit-fields, which are integral values of
a declared integral type with a specified bit-width. The specified bit-width
of a bit-field may not be greater than the width of its declared type.

A bit-field must be contained in a block of memory that is appropriate to
store its declared type, but it can share an addressable byte with
other members of the struct or union.

When determining the alignment and size of the structure or the union,
only the member bitfields' declared integral types are considered, and
their specified width is irrelevant.

It is possible to define unnamed bit-fields in C. The declared type of these
bit-fields do not affect the alignment of a structure or union.

Zero-length bitfields defined in C and C++ should be ignored and take up
no storage space in memory or in the registers.


== Subroutine calling sequence

A subroutine as described in this specification may have none or arbitrary number
of *arguments* and one *return value*. Each argument or return value have
exactly one of the machine data types.

The standard calling requirements apply only to functions exported to linker-editors
and dynamic loaders. Local functions that are not reachable from other compilation
units may use other calling conventions.

Empty structure / union arguments and return values should be simply ignored by C
compilers which support them as a non-standard extension.

=== The registers

The rationale of the LoongArch procedure calling convention is to pass
arguments and return values in registers as long as it is possible, so that
memory access and/or cache usage can be reduced to improve program performance.

The registers that can be used for passing arguments and returning values are
the *argument registers*, which include:

* *GARs*: 8 general-purpose registers `$a0` - `$a7`, where `$a0` and `$a1` are
also used for integral values.

* *FARs*: 8 floating-point registers `$fa0` - `$fa7`, where `$fa0` and `$fa1`
are also used for returning values.

An argument is passed using the stack only when no appropriate argument register
is available.

Subroutines should ensure that the initial values of the general-purpose registers
`$s0` - `$s9` and floating-point registers `$fs0` - `$fs7` are preserved across
the call.

At the entry of a procedure call, the return address of the call site is stored
in `$ra`. A branch jump to this address should be the last instruction executed
in the called procedure.

=== The Stack Layout

Each called subroutine in a program may have a stack frame on the run-time stack.
A stack frame is a contiguous block of memory with the following layout:

[caption=]
[%header,cols="^1,^2,^1"]
|===
|Position      |Content         |Frame

|incoming `$sp` +
(high address)
|_(optional padding)_ +
incoming stack arguments
|Previous

|
|... +
saved registers +
local variables +
paddings
.2+|Current

|outgoing `$sp` +
(low address)
|_(optional padding)_ +
outgoing stack arguments
|===

The stack frame is allocated by subtracting a positive value from the stack
pointer `$sp`. Upon procedure entry, the stack pointer is required to be
divisible by 16, ensuring a 16-byte alignment of the frame.

The first argument object passed on the stack (which may be the argument itself
or its on-stack portion) is located at offset 0 of the incoming stack pointer;
the following argument objects are stored at the lowest subsequent addresses that
meet their respective alignment requirements.

Procedures must not assume the persistence of on-stack data of which
the addresses lie below the stack pointer.


=== Passing arguments

When determining the layout of argument data, the arguments should be assigned to
their locations in the program context sequentially, in the order they appear in
the argument list.

The location of an argument passed by value may be either one of:

1. An argument register.
2. A pair of argument registers with adjacent numbers.
3. A GAR and an FAR.
4. A contiguous block of memory in the stack arguments region, with a constant
offset from the caller's outgoing `$sp`.
5. A combination of 1. and 4.

The on-stack part of the structure and scalar arguments are aligned to
the greater of the type alignment and GRLEN bits, except when this alignment
is larger than the 16-byte stack alignment. In this case, the part of the
argument should be 16-byte-aligned.

In a procedure call, GARs / FARs are generally only used for passing
non-floating-point / floating-point argument data, respectively.
However, the floating-point member of a structure or union argument,
or a floating-point argument wider than FRLEN may be passed in a GAR.
For example, a quadruple-precision floating-point argument may be passed or
returned in a pair of GARs if the GARs are 64-bit wide, otherwise it would be
passed or returned on the stack.

NOTE: Currently, the following detailed description of parameter passing rules
is only guaranteed to cover the `lp64d` and `lp64s` variant, that is, `GRLEN` is
`64` and `FRLEN` is `64` or `0`.

NOTE: In the following text, w~arg~ is used for denoting the size of the
argument object in bits.

==== Scalars of fundamental types

There are two cases:

*0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN*

* The argument is passed in a single argument register, or on the stack by value
if none is available.

* An fp32 / fp64 argument is passed in an FAR if there is one available.
Otherwise, it is passed in a GAR, or on the stack if none of the GARs are
available. When passed in registers or on the stack, fp32 / fp64 arguments
narrower than GRLEN bits are widened to GRLEN bits, with the upper bits undefined.

* An integral argument is passed in a GAR if there is one available.
Otherwise, it is passed on the stack. If the argument is narrower than the
containing GAR, the <<int_ext_rules, general rules of integral extensions>>
applies.

*GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN*

* The argument is passed in a pair of GARs with adjacent numbers, with the
lower-ordered GRLEN bits in the low-numbered register. If only one GAR
is available, the lower-ordered GRLEN bits are passed in this register
and the most-significant GRLEN bits are passed on the stack. If no GAR is
available, the whole argument is passed on the stack.

==== Structures
// TODO: nested structures where the member strcture can be passed in
// one GAR / FAR
// TODO: alignment of the on-stack part of a structure / union
// that is "broken apart".

The storage location of structures during argument passing is also determined
by w~arg~ and GRLEN:

NOTE: Zero-length array members in structures should be ignored by both C and
C++ compilers.

*w~arg~ > 2 × GRLEN*

* The structure is passed by reference, i.e. replaced in the argument list
with its memory address. If there is an available GAR, the address is passed
in the GAR, otherwise it is passed on the stack.

*0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN*

* If the structure contains only one or two fp32 / fp64 members,
and the same number of FARs are available, the members are passed in
the FARs respectively, with the first member in the lower-numbered
register.

* If the structure contains a fp32 / fp64 member and an integral
member, when an FAR and a GAR is available, the fp32 / fp64 member
of the structure is passed in the FAR, and the integer member of the
structure is passed in the GAR. If no FAR but one GAR is available,
the structure is passed in the GAR. If no GAR is available,
is then passed on the stack.

* In other cases, if there is an available GAR, the structure is passed in
this register, otherwise it is passed on the stack.

*GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN*

* If the structure contains only two fp64 members, or an fp64 member and
an fp32 member, they are passed in a pair of adjacent FARs. If the FAR pair
is not available, the structure is passed in a pair of GARs. In both cases,
the first member is stored in the lower-numbered register. If only one GAR
is available, the second member is passed on the stack instead. If no GAR
is available, the structure is then passed on the stack.

* If the structure is in of either of the following situation:

** consists of only one fp128 member
** consists of one fp64 member and two adjacent fp32 members
** consists of 3-4 fp32 members

+
The argument is passed in a pair of available GARs, with the lower-ordered
bits in the lower-numbered register. If only one GAR is available, only the
lower-ordered bits are passed in the GAR, while the rest of the data is
passed on the stack. If no GAR is available, the structure is passed on
the stack.

* If the structure has only one fp32 / fp64 member and one integral
member, the floating-point member of the structure is passed in
the FAR, and the integral member is passed in the GAR. If no FAR
is available, the members will be passed in two adjacent GARs separately.
If only one GAR is available, then the first member is passed in the GAR
and the second one is passed in on the stack. If neither a GAR nor an FAR
is available, all of the structure is passed on the stack.

* Otherwise, the structure is passed in a pair of available GARs, with
the least significant bits stored in the lower-numbered register. If only
one GAR is available, the high-ordered bits passed on the stack instead.
If no GAR is available, all of the structure is passed on the stack.

==== Unions

Unions are only passed in the GARs or on the stack, depending on its width.

*w~arg~ > 2 × GRLEN*

* The union is passed by reference and is replaced in the argument list with
its memory address. If there is an available GAR, the reference is passed in
the GAR, otherwise, the address is passed on the stack.

*0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN*

* The argument is passed in a GAR, or on the stack by value if no GAR is available.

*GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN*

* The argument is passed in a pair of available GARs, with the low-order bits
in the lower-numbered GAR and the high-order bits in the higher-numbered GAR.
If only one GAR is available, the low-order bits are in the GAR and the high-order
bits are on the stack. The arguments are passed on the stack when no GAR is available.

==== Complex floating-points

A complex floating-point number, or a structure containing just one complex
fp32 / fp64 number, is passed as though it were a structure containing two
fp32 / fp64 members.

==== Variadic arguments

Variadic arguments are passed in GARs in the same manner as named arguments.
If one variadic argument is passed on the stack, all subsequent arguments
will also be passed on the stack.

*w~arg~ > 2 × GRLEN*

* The arguments are passed by reference and are replaced in the argument list
with the address. If there is an available GAR, the reference is passed in
the GAR, and passed on the stack if no GAR is available.

*0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN*

* The variadic arguments are passed in a GAR, or on the stack by value if no
GAR is available.

*GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN*

* The variadic arguments are passed in a pair of GARs. If only one GAR is
available, the low-order bits are in the GAR and the high-order bits
are on the stack. Otherwise, all of the the argument data is passed
on the stack by value.

=== Returning

In general, `$a0` and `$a1` are used for returning non-floating-point values,
while `$fa0` and `$fa1` are used for returning floating-point values.

Values are returned in the same manner the first named argument
of the same type would be passed. If such an argument would have
been passed by reference, the caller should allocate memory for the
return value, and passes the address as an implicit first argument
that is stored in `$a0`.
